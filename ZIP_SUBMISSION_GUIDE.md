### Mac/Linux
```bash
# Navigate to parent directory of your project
cd /path/to/parent/directory

# Create zip excluding unnecessary files
zip -r task-manager-laravel-crud.zip task-manager/ \
  -x "task-manager/.env" \
  -x "task-manager/storage/logs/*" \
  -x "task-manager/node_modules/*" \
  -x "task-manager/.git/*"
```
