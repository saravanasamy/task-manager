## üìã Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer (PHP package manager)
- MySQL server (or SQLite for simpler setup)
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) or use PHP built-in server

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Extract the Project
```bash
# Extract the zip file to your desired directory
# For example: C:\xampp\htdocs\task-manager (Windows) or /var/www/html/task-manager (Linux)
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Open command prompt/terminal in the project directory
cd path/to/task-manager

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install
```

#### 3. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment configuration
copy .env.example .env    # Windows
# OR
cp .env.example .env      # Linux/Mac

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate
```

#### 4. Database Configuration

**Option A: MySQL (Recommended)**
1. Create a new database named `task_manager`
2. Edit `.env` file with your database credentials:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=task_manager
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**Option B: SQLite (Simpler)**
1. Edit `.env` file:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=C:\full\path\to\database.sqlite
```
2. Create empty database file:
```bash
touch database/database.sqlite  # Linux/Mac
# OR create empty file manually on Windows
```

#### 5. Database Setup
```bash
# Run migrations to create tables
php artisan migrate

# (Optional) Seed with sample data for testing
php artisan db:seed
```

#### 6. Run the Application
```bash
# Start development server
php artisan serve

# Application will be available at: http://localhost:8000
```

### Alternative Installation (Using XAMPP/WAMP)
1. Extract project to `htdocs` folder
2. Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP
3. Create database through phpMyAdmin
4. Follow steps 2-5 above
5. Access via `http://localhost/task-manager/public`

## üß™ Testing the Application

### Sample Data
After running `php artisan db:seed`, you'll have 8 sample tasks with different statuses and due dates for immediate testing.

### Key Features to Test
1. **Task Creation** - Try creating tasks with various statuses and due dates
2. **Filtering** - Test status filters, date ranges, and overdue filter
3. **Search** - Search for tasks by title or description
4. **Sorting** - Click column headers to sort tasks
5. **Bulk Operations** - Select multiple tasks and perform bulk actions
6. **Responsive Design** - Test on different screen sizes

## üíº Architecture & Code Quality

### Professional Practices Demonstrated
- **Service Layer Pattern** - Business logic separated from HTTP concerns
- **Form Request Validation** - Dedicated validation classes
- **Model Scopes** - Reusable query logic
- **Dependency Injection** - Proper service registration
- **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
- **Security** - CSRF protection and input validation

### Code Organization
```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Http/Controllers/    # Thin controllers (delegate to services)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Http/Requests/      # Form validation classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/             # Eloquent models with relationships
