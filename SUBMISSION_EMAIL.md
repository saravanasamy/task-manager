   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   - Create a MySQL database named `task_manager`
   - Update `.env` file with your database credentials:
   ```
   DB_DATABASE=task_manager
   DB_USERNAME=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

5. **Run Migrations**
   ```
   php artisan migrate

## üéØ Testing the Application

Once installed, you can:
‚Ä¢ Create new tasks using the "New Task" button
‚Ä¢ Filter tasks by status, due date, or search terms
‚Ä¢ Sort tasks by clicking column headers
‚Ä¢ Use bulk operations by selecting multiple tasks
‚Ä¢ View detailed task information and edit existing tasks

The sample data (if seeded) includes various task examples with different statuses and due dates for immediate testing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

The application demonstrates professional development practices:
‚Ä¢ **TaskService** - Handles all business logic and data operations
‚Ä¢ **TaskValidationService** - Centralized validation rules and business constraints  
‚Ä¢ **Thin Controllers** - Clean separation of HTTP handling from business logic
‚Ä¢ **Model Scopes** - Reusable query logic for efficient filtering
‚Ä¢ **Service Provider** - Proper dependency injection setup

- **PHP:** 8.2+
- **Database:** MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+
- **Memory:** 512MB minimum
- **Disk Space:** 50MB for application files

## üìû Support & Questions

If you encounter any issues during installation or have questions about the implementation, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm available to provide clarification on any technical decisions or demonstrate specific features.

The application is production-ready and includes comprehensive error handling, so it should install smoothly following the above instructions.

## üéØ Development Notes

**Time Investment:** Approximately 2 hours for core requirements, with additional time invested in code quality, architecture, and bonus features to demonstrate professional standards.

**Technical Approach:** Focused on clean code, scalability, and maintainability rather than just meeting minimum requirements.
